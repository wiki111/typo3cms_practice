Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started, we have created a small hello world application.

1) Open the hello-world.php file

2) Follow the run instructions in the file's comments

3) If you want to look at the Apache logs, check out ~/lib/apache2/log

And that's all there is to it! Just have fun. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
The Cloud9 IDE team

##### About Installing Typo3 CMS - If you ever need to do it again - Note to self ######

Successfull installation was achived by following the install tool instructions
with disregard of any problems which could be ommited. After installation was 
complete changed trustedHostWhatever to ".*" and changed [BE][lockIP] to 0. 
This solved the initial problem of backend logging out immediately and lack of 
ability do display frontend.
