.. _introduction-what:

What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension contains a lot of code samples that are used throughout
the TYPO3 Core Documentation. The goals are two-fold:

#. provide an easy way for users to gain access to these examples for
   their own use.

#. store all code examples in a central place, so that it is easier for
   documentation maintainers to reproduce the examples from the
   documentation, in particular when refreshing the screenshots.

The usage of these examples is **not** explained in this manual. It
is explained in the relevant documentation.

Not all code examples from the Core Documentation will be moved here
as it is a rather huge task. Whenever possible code samples are taken
from the TYPO3 Core itself. Furthermore priority is given to those
code samples that are related to screenshots.


.. _introduction-status:

Current status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current version was tested with TYPO3 CMS 6.2. Examples may apply
to older versions, but since all examples use namespaces, porting them
to versions prior to TYPO3 CMS 6.0 will require extra work.


.. _introduction-credits:

Credits
^^^^^^^

Some of the examples were originally created by Kasper Skårhøj.
